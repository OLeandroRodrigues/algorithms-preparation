# 📖 Formal Proofs

This folder contains **formal proofs of correctness and complexity** for the algorithms implemented in the repository.  
The goal is to demonstrate not only *how* the algorithms work in code, but also *why* they are correct and efficient.

## 📝 Proof Format

Each proof follows a consistent structure:

1. **Invariant** (when applicable, e.g., Binary Search, Merge process)  
2. **Correctness** (formal argument that the algorithm produces the right result)  
3. **Termination** (argument that the algorithm always finishes)  
4. **Time Complexity** (recurrence, Master Theorem, or Akra–Bazzi when relevant)  
5. **Space Complexity** (stack, auxiliary arrays, memory considerations)  
6. **Additional Notes** (stability, edge cases, practical implementation notes)  
7. **📷 Handwritten Draft** (optional) → my initial handwritten reasoning included in `img/` for authenticity
