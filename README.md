This repository contains my **data structures and algorithms practice**,  
with a focus on **Big Tech interviews** and **formal proofs of correctness and complexity**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Languages

- **Python** â†’ chosen for its **clarity and conciseness**, ideal for interviews.  
- **Java** â†’ a **compiled, strongly typed language**, aligned with my **OCP Java SE 11 certification preparation**.  
- **C#** â†’ a **compiled language**, leveraging **13+ years of enterprise experience**.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `python/` â†’ Python implementations (algorithms, data structures, problems, tests)
- `java/` â†’ Java implementations (same structure as above)
- `csharp/` â†’ C# implementations (same structure as above)
- `templates/` â†’ Reusable README templates (algorithm_readme.md, ds_readme.md, problem_readme.md)

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests

- **Python** â†’ [Python tests](./python/tests/)  
- **Java** â†’ [Java tests](./java/tests/)  
- **C#** â†’ [C# tests](./csharp/tests/)  

Each implementation has unit tests covering correctness and edge cases.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

- [ ] Search (all languages)  
- [ ] Sorting (all languages)  
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (all languages)
- [ ] Graphs (all languages)
- [ ] Trees (all languages)
- [ ] Greedy (all languages)
- [ ] Backtracking (all languages)
- [ ] Patterns (all languages)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is more than just coding solutions:  

- Practice of **core CS fundamentals** (search, sorting, trees, graphs, DP, greedy, backtracking).  
- Each algorithm/data structure folder includes its **theoretical background**: proof of correctness, termination arguments, and complexity analysis.  
- Demonstration of versatility across **concise scripting (Python)** and **compiled OOP languages (Java & C#)**.  
- Highlights both the **engineering perspective** (clean, production-ready code, unit tests) and the **theoretical perspective** (formal reasoning, invariants, and handwritten drafts).

ðŸ“· Visuals such as diagrams, step-by-step traces, and scanned handwritten notes are stored in each algorithmâ€™s local `assets/` folder and linked inside the corresponding `README.md`.
