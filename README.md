This repository contains my **data structures and algorithms practice**,  
with a focus on **Big Tech interviews** and **formal proofs of correctness and complexity**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Languages

- **Python** â†’ chosen for its **clarity and conciseness**, ideal for interviews.  
- **Java** â†’ a **compiled, strongly typed language**, aligned with my **OCP Java SE 11 certification preparation**.  
- **C#** â†’ a **compiled language**, leveraging **13+ years of enterprise experience**.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `python/`, `java/`, `csharp/` â†’ code and unit tests  
- `proofs/` â†’ formal proofs (correctness, termination, complexity) + handwritten drafts (`img/`)  

---

## ðŸ“‘ Proofs

See [`proofs/README.md`](./proofs/README.md) for the structure and index of formal proofs.  

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests

- **Python** â†’ [`python/README.md`](./python/README.md)  
- **Java** â†’ [`java/README.md`](./java/README.md)  
- **C#** â†’ [`csharp/README.md`](./csharp/README.md)  

Each implementation has unit tests covering correctness and edge cases.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

- [ ] Search (all languages)  
- [ ] Sorting (all languages)  
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (all languages)
- [ ] Graphs (all languages)
- [ ] Trees (all languages)
- [ ] Greedy (all languages)
- [ ] Backtracking (all languages)
- [ ] Patterns (all languages)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is more than just coding solutions:  

- Practice of **core CS fundamentals** (search, sorting, trees, graphs, DP, greedy, backtracking).  
- Documentation of **formal reasoning** â†’ proofs of correctness, termination, and complexity analysis.  
- Demonstration of versatility across **concise scripting (Python)** and **compiled OOP languages (Java & C#)**.  
- Showcasing both the **engineering perspective** (unit tests, clean code) and the **theoretical perspective** (mathematical proofs).

ðŸ“· Some proofs also include my **handwritten drafts** in `/img/` to illustrate the reasoning process behind the final formalization.
