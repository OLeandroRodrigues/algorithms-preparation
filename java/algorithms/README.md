# 📊 Algorithms (Sorting|Selection)

This folder contains implementations and theoretical analysis of **sorting algorithms** and **selection algorithms**.  
Each algorithm is documented in its own subfolder, including code, proof of correctness, complexity analysis, and visualizations (`assets/`).

## 🎯 Purpose: Sorting 
Sorting is one of the most fundamental problems in Computer Science.  
Studying different sorting algorithms helps understand **algorithm design paradigms** such as:
- Incremental (Insertion Sort)  
- Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)  
- Heap-based approaches (Heap Sort)  

## 🎯 Purpose: Selection
Selection algorithms address the problem of finding a specific order statistic (e.g., the k-th smallest or largest element) without fully sorting the data.

Studying **selection algorithms** deepens the understanding of efficient data partitioning and trade-offs between sorting and targeted search.
They are essential for:
- Finding medians and percentiles in large datasets
- Statistical sampling and order statistics computation
- Optimizing performance when full sorting is unnecessary

Exploring algorithmic paradigms such as:
- Divide and Conquer (QuickSelect)
- Deterministic Linear-Time Selection (Median of Medians / BFPRT)
- Heap-based approaches for k-smallest or k-largest elements
