# 📦 Data Structures

This folder contains implementations and theoretical analysis of **fundamental data structures**.  
Each data structure is organized in its own subfolder, including code, proof of correctness, complexity analysis, and illustrative diagrams (`assets/`).

## 📂 Index of Data Structures

- [Max Heap and Min Heap](./heap/README.md)  
- [Priority Queue](./priority_queue/README.md)  
- [Stack](./stack/README.md) 
- [Queue](./queue/README.md)  
- [Singly Linked List](./linkedlist/README.md)  
- [Doubly Linked List](./linkedlist/doubly_linked_list/README.md)  
- [Circular Linked List](./linkedlist/circular_linked_list/README.md)  
- [Hash Table](./hash_table/README.md)  

## 🎯 Purpose

Data structures are the backbone of Computer Science.  
Understanding them provides the foundation for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems.  

Key concepts include:
- Memory organization and element access (Arrays, Linked Lists)  
- Abstract data types and encapsulation (Stacks, Queues)  
- Efficient storage and retrieval (Hash Tables, Heaps)  
- Hierarchical models (Trees, Graphs)

📘 Note: Each subfolder provides both **implementation details** and **theoretical insights**, aiming to bridge coding practice with mathematical rigor.
