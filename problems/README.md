# ðŸ§© Problems (Python Only)

This folder contains **algorithmic problems** implemented in **two complementary styles**:

---

## ðŸ§± Naming Convention

Each problem has **two versions**, reflected in the filename:

| Version | File suffix | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| ðŸ§© **From Scratch** | `_from_scratch.py` | Interview-style implementation where all necessary data structures are coded manually, without imports. |
| ðŸ§© **Repo-based** | `_repo_based.py` | Engineering-style solution reusing the data structures and algorithms implemented in [`/python`](../python). |

**Example (Heap topic):**
```bash
heap/
â”œâ”€â”€ top_k_elements_from_scratch.py # manual heap implementation (interview-style)
â”œâ”€â”€ top_k_elements_repo_based.py # uses PriorityQueue or MaxHeap from the repo
â””â”€â”€ README.md
