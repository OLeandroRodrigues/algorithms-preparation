# 📝 Heap Sort Proof

## 📚 Metadata
- **Creator / Inventor**: J. W. J. Williams (he also invented the heap structure)
- **Country of Origin**: England
- **Institution (if applicable)**: King's College, University of London.
- **Year of Creation / Publication**: Williams introduced the heap specifically to support the Heapsort algorithm, which was also
 described in that same paper (Communications of the ACM, July 1964). 

## 📝 Description
Input: A sequence of n number (a1, a2, ..., an)
Output: A permutation (a'1,a'2, ..., a'n) such that a'1 <= a'2 <= ... <= a'n
In other words, reording an array of numbers in decreasing or increasing way

## 📝 Pseudocode
cpp
``` 
BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A,n)
1   A.heap-size = n
2   for i = [n/2] downto 1
3       MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)

```
