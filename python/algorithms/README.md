# ðŸ“Š Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains implementations and theoretical analysis of **sorting algorithms**.  
Each algorithm is documented in its own subfolder, including code, proof of correctness, complexity analysis, and visualizations (`assets/`).

## ðŸ“‚ Index of Sorting Algorithms

- [Insertion Sort](./insertion_sort/README.md)  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Sorting is one of the most fundamental problems in Computer Science.  
Studying different sorting algorithms helps understand **algorithm design paradigms** such as:
- Incremental (Insertion Sort)  
- Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)  
- Heap-based approaches (Heap Sort)
