# ðŸ“¦ Data Structures

This folder contains implementations and theoretical analysis of **fundamental data structures**.  
Each data structure is organized in its own subfolder, including code, proof of correctness, complexity analysis, and illustrative diagrams (`assets/`).

## ðŸ“‚ Index of Data Structures

- [Max Heap](./heap/README.md)  
- [Min Heap](./heap/README.md)  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Data structures are the backbone of Computer Science.  
Understanding them provides the foundation for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems.  

Key concepts include:
- Memory organization and element access (Arrays, Linked Lists)  
- Abstract data types and encapsulation (Stacks, Queues)  
- Efficient storage and retrieval (Hash Tables, Heaps)  
- Hierarchical models (Trees, Graphs)

ðŸ“˜ Note: Each subfolder provides both **implementation details** and **theoretical insights**, aiming to bridge coding practice with mathematical rigor.
